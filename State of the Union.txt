S"Why Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union still matters in the Twitter era - Yahoo News\n\nFollow Yahoo News\n\nRecommended Games\n\nDone\n\nView photo\n\nPresident Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress, on Jan. 28, 2014. (Bill O'Leary/Washington Post via Getty)\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s 2015. We live in the era of tablets, smartphones, live-streams, online interactives, listicles, viral content and social media. So why is President Barack Obama, whose White House uses those tools expertly to get its message around traditional news outlets and directly to the public, preparing to trudge through the stodgy yearly ritual that is the State of the Union?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs \xe2\x80\x98the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99 too cheeky an answer?\xe2\x80\x9d senior Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer replied with a laugh when Yahoo News asked him last week.\n\ndoes say that the president \xe2\x80\x9cshall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\xe2\x80\x9d It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t specify that he should do so in a primetime TV speech sometimes lampooned as \xe2\x80\x9cI come to you tonight to speak in ringing tones and gaze into the middle-distance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 SOTU, as it is often abbreviated by D.C. insiders, drew 33.3 million television viewers, . The Super Bowl last year pulled in 111.5 million viewers.\n\nView gallery\n\nPresident Barack Obama delivers the State of Union address before a joint session of Congress in the House chamber \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nBut \xe2\x80\x9cit will be the largest audience we speak to in the year by far, absent some major, major, major event,\xe2\x80\x9d Pfeiffer said.\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s a uniquely presidential perk, he emphasized: \xe2\x80\x9cWe will talk directly to more people than probably every politician of note in America will do in all their speeches combined this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStill, dropping television viewership and the rise of new technologies have forced the White House \xe2\x80\x9cto work a lot harder and be a lot smarter\xe2\x80\x9d to get the most out of the speech, Pfeiffer said.\n\nThe White House sees the speech as having four audiences.\n\nFirst, there are the people in the room and those watching on live television. They need \xe2\x80\x9ca good, compelling speech,\xe2\x80\x9d Pfeiffer said.\n\nSecond, there are those watching the speech on their laptops, notably on the White House live-stream. For them, the White House plans to make available in-depth data, accessible from the live-stream page. For example, someone interested in Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to make community college tuition free for some students would be able to click on a link that details the policy.\n\nThird, there are two-screen viewers, those watching the speech on TV but holding a tablet or a phone and getting a constant stream of commentary through social media. The White House will be present on major second-screen sites like Twitter, offering links to policy outlines, pictures, short videos and other items, even as White House aides closely watch the Twitter feeds of influential media figures to battle \xe2\x80\x9cbrushfires\xe2\x80\x9d of criticisms that can spread quickly to reporters covering the speech and land in the papers the next day.\n\nFourth, there\xe2\x80\x99s an audience for the speech that will never watch it on TV and will never sit down to watch it on demand, or read it in full, or ever even visit the White House website. Obama aides will target those people via social media, slicing and dicing the speech into key issue components, each of which will get elements like videos or graphics that can be shared or go on to live on the homepages of influential news outlets or advocacy groups.\n\nSo while declining TV numbers have forced the White House to chase audiences across the social media landscape, the result has been to give the speech a longer life online.\n\nStill, despite the importance of social media, Pfeiffer said the speech is not crafted with the need for 140-character Twitter-bites in mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to write the speech, and it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a document that lives in the history books and for the people in the room watching it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how I think about it has changed,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI read it for shareable moments. When the speech is written, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go through it and look and say, \xe2\x80\x98This, this, this and this, these are things that have the potential to have real resonance online, either because they speak to an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s powerful \xe2\x80\x94 like immigration or climate change \xe2\x80\x94 that get a lot of traction online, or it\xe2\x80\x99s like a really emotional thing, or a powerful thing or a funny thing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then we\xe2\x80\x99ll design our amplification strategy around those moments because we know our best case for the people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to watch will be short video snippets\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwhat lends itself to an infographic,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nView gallery\n\nPresident Obama fine tunes his State of the Union address with Chief Speechwriter Cody Keenan. Photo released on \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nAs in 2014, the job of writing the address has fallen chiefly on the shoulders of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s lead speechwriter, 34-year-old Cody Keenan. (For how that process unfolds, )\n\nThis year seems to be taking a particular toll on Keenan, who has told White House colleagues that he is getting three hours of sleep a night and has become completely immune to caffeine.\n\nAnd unlike Raymond Price, a long-ago speechwriter for Richard Nixon, Keenan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the option to write the remarks during amphetamines prescribed by the White House doctor.\n\n\xee\x81\x88\n\n)\n\nWhat to read next"

S'State of the Union: Obama proposals show president on \xe2\x80\x98offense\xe2\x80\x99 despite GOP wave | Fox News\n\nSign in to comment!\n\nLogin\n\nWhite House\n\nState of the Union: Obama proposals show president on \xe2\x80\x98offense\xe2\x80\x99 despite GOP wave\n\nPublished January 19, 2015\nFoxNews.com\n\nFrom calls for more infrastructure spending to a free community college push to another tax hike scheme, the highlight reel from President Obama\'s looming State of the Union address shows him charging into his final two years in office with little heed for the results of the midterms.\n\nThe Republican takeover of the Senate last November -- and the party\'s historic gains in the House -- for a short time fueled speculation that the president might entertain a more conciliatory approach with Congress.\n\nBut within weeks, the president announced sweeping changes to immigration policy via executive action. Then, he vowed to veto a slew of bills from the new Congress, including one to undo those executive actions. And now, his State of the Union address leaves little doubt that Obama, as he told Senate Democrats last week, plans to play "offense" against the GOP-led Congress.\n\nThe latest plank of his 2015 agenda was unveiled Saturday night, and calls for more than $300 billion in new tax increases over the next 10 years, to pay for middle class tax credits and his community college plan, among other programs.\n\nAlready, Republicans are describing the plan as a "non-starter" with the new Congress.\n\n*\nDoes the State of the Union matter anymore?\n\n*\nIs Pres. Obama playing Robin Hood with tax the rich plan?\n\n"More Washington tax hikes and spending is the same, old top-down approach we\'ve come to expect from President Obama that hasn\'t worked," Michel Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said.\n\nDon Stewart, deputy chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., ripped the president\'s plan and renewed calls to overhaul to whole tax system. "Republicans believe we should simplify America\'s outdated tax code; that tax filing should be easier for you, not just those with fancy accountants; and that tax reform should create jobs for families, not the IRS," he said in a statement.\n\nThe president, unlike past years, has previewed many elements of his State of the Union address in the run-up to the speech. Some, like the tax plan, have already attracted Republican ire.\n\nThey include:\n\nTax hikes, to pay for tax cuts: The centerpiece of the president\'s tax proposal is an increase in the capital gains rate on couples making more than $500,000 per year to 28 percent, the same level as under President Ronald Reagan. The top capital gains rate has already been raised from 15 percent to 23.8 percent during Obama\'s presidency.\n\nObama also wants to close what the administration is calling the "trust fund loophole," a change that would require estates to pay capital gains taxes on securities at the time they\'re inherited. Officials said the overwhelming impact of the change would be on the top 1 percent of income earners.\n\nAdministration officials pointed to a third proposal from the president as one they hope Republicans would support: a fee on the roughly 100 U.S. financial firms with assets of more than $50 billion. Raising the capital gains rate, ending the inheritance loophole and tacking a fee on financial firms would generate $320 billion in revenue over a decade, according to administration estimates.\n\nObama wants to put the bulk of that money into a series of measures aimed at helping middle-class Americans. This would include expanding the child care tax credit, offering up to $3,000 per child for families making up to $120,000 a year. And it would include a new $500 credit to "second earners" in a family, to help a spouse pay for additional costs entailed when both spouses work -- like child care.\n\nFree community college: The president wants to offer two years of free community college to students who can keep a 2.5 GPA. The White House estimates the program would cost the federal government roughly $60 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe White House wants the federal government covering three-quarters of tuition costs, and states picking up the rest.\n\nWorkplace leave: Obama is urging Congress and local governments to back measures allowing workers to earn up to a week of paid sick time a year. As part of this effort, he wants Congress to approve more than $2 billion in new spending to encourage states to create paid family and medical leave programs.\n\nIn addition, Obama will take steps to provide federal employees with up to six weeks of paid sick leave to care for a new child. And he\'ll propose that Congress pass legislation to give federal workers an additional six weeks of paid parental leave.\n\nInfrastructure: The administration is proposing to create a new municipal bond for public-private partnerships.\n\nA new Water Finance Center at the Environmental Protection Agency also will work with state and local governments, utilities and the private sector to use federal grants to leverage private capital to address more than $600 billion in needs for drinking water and wastewater management.\n\nHousing help: Obama earlier this month announced plans the White House says could save homeowners $900 a year. Under the plan, at the end of this month, the Federal Housing Administration mortgage premium will drop from 1.35 percent to 0.85 percent. In addition to the 250,000 new homebuyers the White House hopes to attract -- a figure that marks a modest increase in sales -- administration officials said the rate cut would help 800,000 homeowners who refinance their mortgages.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n*\nWashington gov, Seattle mayor ban official travel to Indiana in wake of \'religious freedom\' law\n\n*\nSupreme Court rejects appeal by US flag-wearing students\n\n*\nHotel for Michelle Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Cambodia visit cost $242,500\n\n*\n\xe2\x80\x98Down to the wire\xe2\x80\x99: US races clock for Iran nuke deal despite warnings\n\n*\nSpokesman for Missouri state auditor found dead 1 month after boss killed himself\n\nSee all Trends'

S'State of the Union focuses on community college, tax relief, family leave - Nation - The Boston Globe\n\nState of the Union focuses on community college, tax relief, family leave - Nation - The Boston Globe\n\nMandel Ngan/Getty Images/Pool\n\nPresident Obama delivered the State of the Union address at the US Capitol.\n\nBy Globe Staff January 21, 2015\n\nWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 President Obama Tuesday night outlined a robust agenda to guide his final two years in office, boldly claiming credit for a rebounding economy and confidently focusing on populist themes that aim to close the growing income-inequality gap and bolster the middle class.\n\nDelivering remarks in a House chamber filled with more Republicans than it has held in decades, Obama used his sixth State of the Union address to propose plans for providing free community college, tax relief for the middle class, and expanded paid family leave for new parents.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said during an hourlong address. \xe2\x80\x9cWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said again and again how far America has come, from times of war and recession at the beginning of his term to a period where combat missions have ended and, he said, the economy has recovered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shadow of crisis has passed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the state of the union is strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s most far-reaching ideas \xe2\x80\x94 and also least likely to pass Congress \xe2\x80\x94 is a proposal for $320 billion in tax increases over 10 years that would target the wealthy and raise capital gains tax rates while providing tax cuts for middle-income earners.\n\nAlthough many of the proposals could prove unachievable in a gridlocked Washington \xe2\x80\x94 where newly resurgent Republicans now control the House and Senate \xe2\x80\x94 the Democratic president is seeking to secure a legacy as an economic populist while shaping the terms of the debate heading into the 2016 election.\n\nUnlike during his State of the Union addresses the past six years, when dour economic news cast a pall, Obama said the country was finally on sound financial footing. He sought to claim victory for policies that helped the economy rebound, saying that the United States has emerged from a fiscal crisis and now has an opportunity to correct what he considers chronic imbalances.\n\nObama was confident, brash, and upbeat throughout as he continued to tout the success of his policies \xe2\x80\x94 and his political philosophy \xe2\x80\x94 in leading the economy back.\n\nHe managed to both show Democrats why they worked so hard to get him elected twice, while also putting on display for Republicans why they dislike him so.\n\nHe ad libbed at one point, smiling and winking to the packed chamber and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is good news, people!\xe2\x80\x9d At another, he engaged in a little political trash talk, telling Republicans who applauded sarcastically at a line that he had no more campaigns to run, \xe2\x80\x9cI know, because I won both of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMany signs point to an improving economy. With gas prices down, the stock market up, and unemployment at its lowest rate since 2008, Obama referred to a sound foundation upon which he wants to build.\n\nBut while he stood before Congress, the message appeared aimed not at trying again to work with emboldened Republicans but at trying to win over the American public. He spent the weeks leading up to the State of the Union traveling the country and outlining some of his plans.\n\nOn Tuesday night, his administration planned a bigger presence on social media, trying to capture a younger audience less likely to tune in or read traditional news coverage.\n\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bypass Congress are also part of his new political reality: He came into office with Democrats in control of both the House and Senate, allowing his party to implement broad changes in health care and financial regulatory laws.\n\nBut after losing the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014, Obama now faces a far more vigorous opposition to anything he proposes.\n\nRepublicans almost immediately panned Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposals. Even before the party\xe2\x80\x99s official response, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who is considering running in 2016, weighed in, saying the president was \xe2\x80\x9cmore intent on winning elections than on winning progress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmericans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa, said in the official Republican response. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nObama, harkening back to a unifying speech he gave in Boston at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, also delivered a new impassioned plea for \xe2\x80\x9ca better politics\xe2\x80\x9d that involves far less emphasis on political fund-raising or arguing on cable TV.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he said Tuesday night. \xe2\x80\x9cA better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than \xe2\x80\x98gotcha\xe2\x80\x99 moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people\xe2\x80\x99s daily lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nObama also called for Congress to pass a resolution giving him the authority to prosecute the five-month-old bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The so-called use-of-force authorization is bound to trigger a robust debate within both parties, with critics claiming it gives the president authority that is too broad and could lead to other foreign conflicts.\n\nObama also called on Congress to pass legislation that would bolster the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to combat breaches of cybersecurity. The plans come on the heels of a security breach at Sony that Obama administration officials say was spearheaded by the North Korean government.\n\nObama, entering a phase of his presidency that he has referred to as the fourth quarter, is taking a more complex approach with Congress.\n\nThere are several areas of compromise \xe2\x80\x94 including potential trade deals with Asia and Europe that Republicans favor while some Democrats oppose \xe2\x80\x94 but the relationship is expected to be much more combative.\n\nObama has only vetoed two bills during his presidency, but just two weeks into this legislative session he has already issued several veto threats.\n\nIn the two months following a Democratic drubbing during the midterm elections, Obama has reasserted himself by using the tools of his office.\n\nHe has signed a broad climate change agreement with China and normalized relations with Cuba. He signed executive actions that halted deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants who meet certain requirements.\n\nHe touched on all of those Tuesday, but his address was mainly aimed at outlining a broad policy agenda, and he did not provide additional proposals for executive actions.\n\nBut he did forcefully call for more efforts to combat climate change, jabbing at Republicans who doubt the science and noting that 14 of the last 15 years have been the warmest on record.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMore State of the Union coverage:\n\nMatt Viser can be reached at .\n\nor\n\nPlease enter a valid email\n\ndiv>\ndiv>\n\nRead it all, now.'

S'Obama: \'Tonight, we turn the page\' - CNN.com\n\n, CNN\n\nUpdated 10:58 PM ET, Tue January 20, 2015\n\nJust Watched\n\nState of the Union address (9)\n\nWashington (CNN)President Barack Obama made a in his penultimate State of the Union Tuesday night, touting the improving economy on his watch and making the case that government has a role in ensuring equal opportunity for all.\n\nObama began his speech at 9:10 p.m. in front of a joint session of the House and Senate, declaring that "the shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the union is strong."\n\n"At this moment -- with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth," he said.\n\n"It\'s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come," he said. "Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?"\n\nObama argued that a raft of new policy proposals \xe2\x80\x94 which include an ambitious plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans and financial institutions to pay for progressive priorities \xe2\x80\x94 favor the middle class, and that "middle-class economics works."\n\nAnd he laid down the gauntlet to Republicans: They\'ll "continue to work, as long as politics don\'t get in the way."\n\nIt\'s a defiant speech for the President, now freed from the shackles of vulnerable red-state Democrats up for re-election and looking to burnish his legacy in his final two years.\n\nInstead of granting Republicans their wish for a realistic compromiser-in-chief chastened by a midterm election drubbing, Obama is attempting to set the terms of an economic debate that could continue into the 2016 race to replace him in the Oval Office.\n\nHe called for cooperation, reprising the theme that there isn\'t a "red America" or "blue America" from the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech that shot Obama into stardom. And he flashed a renewed confidence, going off-script after touting the improving economy to say, "This is good news, people" -- and followed it with a wink.\n\nLater, when Obama said he had no campaigns left to run and some Republicans sarcastically clapped, the President shot back: "I know, \'cause I won both of them."\n\nAt the heart of his message is a Robin Hood-style plan to investments and financial institutions and use that money to foot the bill for and new tax credits for child care and two-worker households.\n\nThat proposal stands next to no chance of clearing Congress. But -- along with campaign-style events and interviews with YouTube stars touting his initiatives both before and after the speech -- Democrats hope Obama\'s decision to play up the parties\' philosophical differences will remind Republicans who now control both the House and the Senate of the political force they couldn\'t overcome in 2008 and 2012.\n\nRepublicans, though, see a President in denial -- one who hasn\'t learned anything from the shellacking that cost his party the Senate in November; whose veto threats and tax-and-spend proposals are a lame duck flailing as his influence fades.\n\nThe President\'s "proposals are so out of touch you have to ask if there is any point to the speech," Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted.\n\nFreshman Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst delivered the GOP\'s response, calling on Obama to "cooperate" with congressional leaders to advance new trade pacts and overhaul the tax code.\n\nBut she also said now that her party controls both the House and the Senate, changes are coming -- and she hit Obama\'s signature health care law while doing it.\n\n"Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare," Ernst said. "It\'s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions."\n\nObama\'s 2012 Republican opponent, Mitt Romney -- who is considering a 2016 run for the White House -- called the speech "disappointing."\n\nRomney said Obama "is more interested in politics than in leadership. More intent on winning elections than on winning progress, he ignores the fact that the country has elected a Congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes."\n\nBut Hillary Clinton, the leading 2016 Democratic contender, praised Obama\'s speech, tweeting that the President "pointed [the] way to an economy that works for all. Now we need to step up and deliver for the middle class."\n\nJust Watched\n\nPLAY VIDEO\n\nBut the White House is wagering that -- with free trade and , two potential areas for deals, as the major exceptions -- there\'s little to be gained in trying to bargain with a Congress already bent on forcing showdowns with Obama on immigration, the , Cuba, health care and more.\n\nThey see an opening: The economy has improved, the President\'s approval rating now tops 50% for the first time in years, and, free of the constraints he felt ahead of the midterm elections, an emboldened Obama is unfurling a series of executive actions to check item after item off his long-stalled to-do list.\n\nThis could be his best shot at pivoting from an unending series of fiscal crises and legislative battles toward an economic debate that could set the tone for the last two years of his presidency -- and for a 2016 race that had been about moving past him.\n\nJust Watched\n\nPLAY VIDEO\n\nTaking top billing in Tuesday night\'s speech is the tax-and-spend plan Obama has rolled out in recent days.\n\nThe benefits would largely go to students and young families: The child care tax credit would triple to $3,000; households in which both spouses work could qualify for a new $500 credit; and college students and those repaying loans could get breaks thanks to Obama\'s plan to make two-year community college degrees free.\n\nFooting the bill are : a total of $320 billion over 10 years by targeting wealthy individuals and banks. Paying most of the price would be couples earning more than $500,000, who would see their capital gains rate jump from 23.8% to 28%. More inherited assets would be subject to capital gains taxes and top financial firms would face new fees.\n\nJust Watched\n\nPLAY VIDEO\n\nObama is also making his own moves to give federal workers once their children are born -- and he\'s lobbying lawmakers to pass a bill allowing workers to earn , and pushing local governments to set up their own sick leave programs.\n\nBefore the speech, Republican congressional leaders made clear that Obama\'s proposals are dead on arrival.\n\n"It all looks like the same old tax and spend that the president has been advocating for the last six years," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) said.\n\nHe called "another income redistribution effort" and said it won\'t help Congress work on a comprehensive tax overhaul.\n\n"Hopefully that\'s just rhetoric," McConnell said. "He knows we\'re not likely to pass these kinds of measures. And we\'ll still look for things that we can actually agree on to try and make some progress here."\n\nHere are several other issues that have dominated the news in recent weeks, and how Obama addressed them in the prepared text of his speech:\n\nFIGHTING ISIS: Obama said that "American leadership, including our military power" has played a key role in stopping ISIS, and called on Congress to authorize the use of military force against the group in Iraq and Syria.\n\nJust Watched\n\nPLAY VIDEO\n\n"Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. ... This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed," he said. "And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL."\n\nCYBERSECURITY: The President asked Congress to approve legislation that would allow more closely to thwart online attacks -- a proposal that could win the support of the GOP-led Congress.\n\n"No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids," Obama said. "We are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children\'s information."\n\n: Perhaps the richest pageantry of the night is over the decades-old economic and diplomatic freeze with the small island country. Obama had , the U.S. contractor he had secured in November. The President\'s , had asked Cuban activist Rosa Mar\xc3\xada Pay\xc3\xa1 to come as his guest. She\'s the daughter of Oswaldo Pay\xc3\xa1, a pro-democracy activist who was killed in a 2012 crash in which the car\'s driver has said it was deliberately targeted by Cuban government officials.\n\nJust Watched\n\nPLAY VIDEO\n\n"When what you\'re doing doesn\'t work for fifty years, it\'s time to try something new," Obama said. "Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo."\n\nIRAN: The White House had extended the deadline for its negotiations with Iran to end the country\'s nuclear program, but lawmakers have said they\'ve run out of patience with the Iranian regime and want to impose new sanctions. Obama .\n\n"There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails -- alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again," he said. "It doesn\'t make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress."\n\nFREE TRADE: Obama risked angering his own base by asking lawmakers to hand him authority to fast-track Pacific Rim and European Union trade deals through Congress with limited debate and no amendments -- a power seen as crucial to finalizing those negotiations with foreign leaders. He posited the trade deals as an opportunity to combat China\'s growing influence in Asia.\n\n"Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That\'s why I\'m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren\'t just free, but fair," he said.\n\nAnd in a move to acknowledge liberal criticism, Obama said: "Look, I\'m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven\'t always lived up to the hype, and that\'s why we\'ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95% of the world\'s customers live outside our borders, and we can\'t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they\'re actively looking at bringing jobs back from China. Let\'s give them one more reason to get it done."\n\nINTERNET ACCESS: In an in-the-weeds regulatory proposal that could result in much-faster Internet access for many cities and states, Obama is calling on the Federal Communications Commission against municipalities setting up their own broadband infrastructure.\n\n"I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world," Obama said.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*'

Media requires JavaScript to play.\n\nPresident Obama: "Tonight we turn the page"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nUS President Barack Obama has declared an end to the financial crisis and pledged economic policies to benefit all Americans, in his annual State of the Union address to Congress.\n\n"Tonight, we turn the page," he said. "The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong."\n\ndevised to appeal to working families, Mr Obama outlined his strategy for "middle-class economics".\n\nBut the plans are unlikely to make it past a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nMr Obama also reiterated his foreign policy objectives, saying that the US reserved the "right to act unilaterally" when hunting down terrorists.\n\nAmerica had supported Ukraine throughout its battle with pro-Russia separatists, leaving Russia "isolated, with its economy in tatters", he added.\n\nIn a speech which he described as more focused on values than policies, Mr Obama declared America had recovered after the worst recession since the Depression.\n\nThe president said he planned to build on this growth by providing working families with help in the form of sick and maternity leave and affordable childcare.\n\n"Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?"\n\nArguing that the US had experienced its "fastest economic growth in over a decade", Mr Obama said: "The verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works."\n\nMr Obama\'s speech included plans to build a competitive economy by improving America\'s infrastructure and providing free access to community college.\n\nAt the weekend, the White House also pledged to close tax loopholes on large inheritances, raise capital gains tax on the richest earners from 23.8% to 28% and introduce new fees on US financial firms with assets about $50bn.\n\nSome senior members of the Republican Party dismissed this as "class warfare".\n\nOther plans outlined by the president include:\n\nMr Obama said he would not hesitate to veto any Republican bills that sought to unravel his healthcare, financial regulation or immigration reforms.\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.\n\nThe BBC\'s Katty Kay says battle lines are clearly drawn\n\nOn foreign policy, he called on Congress to pass a resolution to authorise the use of force against the Islamic State militant group.\n\nOn nuclear talks with Iran, the president reiterated his belief that an agreement could be reached to prevent the country from gaining nuclear weapons, and said he would veto any new sanctions bill that undermined negotiations.\n\nHe also said that his decision to begin , after ties were severed in 1961, had the potential to "end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere".\n\n"We are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you\'re doing doesn\'t work for 50 years, it\'s time to try something new," he said.\n\nAlan Gross, who was recently released after spending five years in a Cuban prison, was among Michelle Obama\'s guests to hear the president.\n\nMr Obama said that the US had successfully opposed "Russian aggression" in Ukraine by imposing sanctions, adding: "It is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters".\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denounced the speech as an indication of what he said was the determination of the US to dominate international affairs.\n\nMr Lavrov said: "Obama\'s address yesterday shows that there\'s just one thing at the heart of [their] philosophy: \'We are number one\'... It shows that the United States wants to dominate the world."\n\nMost of this speech must be seen as essentially aspirational, given the Republican control of both houses of Congress - and their antipathy towards the president\n\nSo if this speech stands little chance of becoming legislative reality, what was it all about?\n\nFirst of all legacy. This is a president who seems to be following Winston Churchill\'s maxim that history is written by the winners.\n\nEnding his address, Mr Obama said he was optimistic he could work with Congress, despite months of political gridlock.\n\n"I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I\'ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol - to do what I believe is best for America," he said.\n\nBut consensus with the Republican Party on many of the issues he outlined is unlikely.\n\n, Republican senator and rising star, Joni Ernst, said Americans had not seen solutions from Mr Obama, and criticised his health and immigration policies.\n\n"Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare," she said.\n\nThe senator called on Mr Obama to work with Republicans on issues where they might have common ground - including a trade deal and tax code reform.\n\nMore on This Story\n\nRelated Stories\n\nFrom other news sites\n\n* May require registration or subscription\n\nComments 5 of 975\n\nor to comment and rate comments\n\nAll posts are and must obey the .\n\nShare this page\n\nTop stories\n\nFeatures & Analysis\n\nElsewhere on the BBC\n\nProgrammes\n\nServices\n\nBBC links\n\nThis page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

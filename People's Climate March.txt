S'Thousands rally worldwide over climate change - Yahoo News\n\nFollow Yahoo News\n\nRecommended Games\n\nDone\n\nView gallery\n\nDemonstrators in animal costumes walk in the "People\'s Climate March" in central London September 21, 2014. The London march was one many held worldwide, ahead of the forthcoming U.N. Emergency summit on climate change. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor (BRITAIN - Tags: ENTERTAINMENT POLITICS ENVIRONMENT SOCIETY TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY)\n\nNew York (AFP) - Celebrities, political leaders and the masses rallied in New York and across the globe Sunday demanding urgent action on climate change, with organizers saying 600,000 people hit the streets.\n\nHollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, UN chief Ban Ki-moon and Mayor Bill de Blasio all marched down New York\'s Sixth Avenue, as part of what was proclaimed the largest climate protest worldwide in history.\n\nThere were colorful and boisterous rallies in other major cities in Latin America, Europe, India and Australia, designed to build pressure ahead of a climate-change summit hosted by Ban in New York on Tuesday.\n\nIn New York, where organizers said 310,000 people took part, elderly protesters -- leaning on walking sticks and sitting in wheelchairs -- joined young parents with children in strollers, adults in fancy dress and community groups.\n\nThere were chants of "hey, hey, ho, ho, fossil fuels have got to go," as the good-natured march snaked down Sixth Avenue with giant floats, balloons and banners with slogans such as "Urgent, Save our Planet."\n\nBan, wearing a baseball cap and T-shirt with the words, "I\'m for Climate Action," praised de Blasio for announcing Sunday that New York would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050.\n\n"I am overwhelmed by such a strong power, energy and voice of the people, I hope this voice will be truly reflected to the leaders when they meet on September 23rd," Ban told reporters.\n\n"There is no plan B because we do not have planet B. We have to work and galvanize our action."\n\nThe UN secretary general walked nine blocks in the parade with US former vice president Al Gore, who is now a climate advocate, de Blasio, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and French Ecology Minister Segolene Royal.\n\n"Our mission is to make this a decisive moment, a turning-point moment and I felt today that I was seeing history starting to be made," de Blasio said.\n\n- Melbourne to Bogota-\n\nIn addition to New York, another 270,000 people turned out at about 2,500 events around the world, organizers said.\n\nIn London, an estimated 40,000 people paraded past Trafalgar Square and the Houses of Parliament, including actress Emma Thompson, who likened the threat posed by climate change to a Martian invasion.\n\nThe pressure group Avaaz, which helped organize the rallies, said 30,000 people turned up in Melbourne and at least 15,000 in Berlin, where the crowd braved pouring rain, and another 5,000 in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn Paris, where police estimated that 4,800 people protested, many came on bikes with banners that read, "Climate in danger" or "World leaders, act!"\n\n"Before we could say we didn\'t know. Now we know. Climate change is already under way," Nicolas Hulot, the French president\'s special envoy for the protection of the planet, told the crowd.\n\nIn Madrid, hundreds gathered in front of the environment ministry, brandishing signs with slogans including "There\'s no Planet B," "Change your life, not your climate," and "Our climate, your decision."\n\nIn Cairns, Australia, where finance ministers from G20 nations were meeting, more than 100 people wearing green paper hearts around their necks gathered outside the venue.\n\nHundreds also massed in Sydney and in New Delhi, where around 300 protesters carried placards that read "I want to save forests" and "Coal kills", as they shouted slogans and danced to pounding drum beats.\n\nAn estimated 5,000 people, some on bicycles, rallied in the Colombian capital Bogota, where some played instruments made out of recycled materials to form a noisy backdrop.\n\n- Two million signatures -\n\nRicken Patel, executive director of Avaaz, presented a petition signed by two million people to Ban in New York.\n\n"The march numbers are beating our wildest expectations," Patel said.\n\n"Climate change is not a green issue anymore, it\'s an everybody issue," he said.\n\nThe "People\'s Climate March" in New York was endorsed by more than 1,400 organizations, including environment, faith and justice groups, as well as labor unions. Students mobilized marchers from more than 300 college campuses.\n\nThe protest wound its way from Central Park through midtown on a two-mile (3.2-kilometer) route ending at 11th Avenue between 34th and 38th Streets.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, slightly obscured in the chaos, participants used instruments, alarms and whistles to make as much noise as possible at 1:00 pm.\n\nThe UN meeting Tuesday sets the stage for a crucial conference in Paris in December 2015 aimed at finalizing a new global climate change pact.\n\n\xee\x81\x88\n\n)\n\nWhat to read next\n\n\xc2\xa9 2014 AFP'

S"New York climate march attracts nearly 400,000 people | Fox News\n\nSign in to comment!\n\nLogin\n\nNew York\n\nNew York climate march attracts nearly 400,000 people\n\nBy\n\nPublished September 21, 2014\nFoxNews.com\n\nDemonstrators make their way down Sixth Avenue in New York during the People's Climate March.\n\nThe People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March in New York has attracted nearly 400,000 people, say organizers, making it the largest climate march in history.\n\nThe march aims to shine a spotlight on environmental issues ahead of the U.N. Climate Summit on Sept. 23. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon took part in the two-mile march through the streets of Manhattan, along with musician Sting and actors Leonardo di Caprio and Mark Ruffalo. Former vice president Al Gore and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also were present.\n\nAttendance at the New York march dwarfs the 50,000 people who took part in the Forward on Climate rally in Washington, D.C., last year, and the 80,000 who attended a march at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009. Organizers had predicted that more than 100,000 demonstrators would attend the Manhattan march.\n\nThe New York march was the largest of 2,646 events taking place in 156 countries, according to organizers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe said it would take everyone to change everything -- and everyone showed up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eddie Bautista, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, in a statement.\n\nTo calculate the attendance, organizers used a crowd density analysis formula developed by a professor of game theory and complex systems at Carnegie Mellon University. The formula calculated average crowd density over specific intervals, factoring in the surface area covered by the crowd and the speed and duration of the march.\n\nThe Climate Summit, which President Obama is expected to attend, is timed to coincide with the start of a new U.N. General Assembly session. Advocates for a climate agreement are hoping that the event will breathe new life into the U.N.\xe2\x80\x99s green agenda.\n\nThe U.N. has suffered a number of blows in its push for a climate agreement. Australia\xe2\x80\x99s new government, for example, recently repealed its two-year-old national carbon tax, and countries such as Canada, Russia and Japan have refused to sign on for an extension to the Kyoto Protocol to combat greenhouse gases.\n\nDan Simmons, vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based free market think tank, told FoxNews.com that public desire for greenhouse gas reductions should not be over-stated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnvironmental activists have tried really hard in recent years to raise the profile of greenhouse gas issues,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLimiting greenhouse gas is not something that the majority of Americans consider one of the most pressing issues of our time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimmons highlighted the results of a recent Gallup poll where economic problems were cited by 41 percent of respondents as the most important problem facing America. Just 1 percent of respondents cited the environment and pollution, according to the poll.\n\nLast week, in preparation for the Climate Summit, the U.S. outlined its plan for a possible global climate agreement. The Summit is seen as key milestone on the path to an agreement.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers\n\n*\nMedieval parasite-filled poop found in Jerusalem latrine\n\n*\nTwin fools NASA at brother's launch on 1-year flight\n\n*\nHuge underground city discovered in Turkey--by accident\n\n*\nAncient 4-eyed predator wielded wicked toothy claws\n\n*\nDon't blame brutal winters on climate change: study\n\nSee all Trends"

S'\'Largest-ever\' climate-change march rolls through NYC\n\nThe U.N. says 125 nations will be represented. It\'s the first time in five years that world leaders have gathered to discuss climate change.\n\nThe U.N. summit aims to get world leaders to pledge emission cuts that could become part of a global agreement to be approved at U.N. climate talks next year in Paris.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry will deliver keynote remarks at the summit\'s opening event. He will showcase climate action that the USA is taking at home and present his vision for advancing a global low carbon economy, his office said Sunday.\n\nThe People\'s Climate March and the summit are part of Climate Week NYC, an annual event "to get people together to make the business case for climate action," said Sylvain Biville of the Climate Group, which organizes the week. The Climate Group\'s goal is "a prosperous, low-carbon future," which the group says will be achieved by "a rapid scale-up of low carbon energy and technology."\n\nThis year\'s Climate Week events follow a series of scientific reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that conclude global warming is "unequivocal" and that it is extremely likely that human activity has been the dominant cause since the mid-20th century.\n\nAccording to the IPCC, the world is on a path to exceed a 3.6-degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature, the limit that countries have set to ensure that the world would not suffer the worst effects of climate change.\n\nOn the streets of New York on Sunday, the marchers were led by indigenous groups from around the world. Organizers say many of these indigenous people are often the first victims of climate change.\n\nAt 12:58 p.m., protesters raised their hands above their heads and quieted for a moment of silence to honor them.\n\nEzra Silk, 25, of Portland, Maine, said the USA has to take action on climate change if it wants to protect the nation\'s democracy. He pointed to Syria as an example of how climate change can contribute to a country\'s collapse.\n\n"There was the worst drought in its modern history," said Silk, co-founder of The Climate Mobilization, which advocates a World War II-scale intervention on climate change. "It caused a major upheaval when all the farmers came into the cities. There was a tyrant, who then oppressed his people, a civil war broke out, destabilizing the entire region, and a group like ISIS has come to the forefront. I mean that\'s the embodiment of what America is not about, and that\'s what collapse of civilization would look like."\n\nMany families brought their children to the march, pointing to them as the reason the tide must change.\n\nRobyn Moore, 39, was at the rally with her husband, Martin Moore, 40, their daughter, Charlotte, 4, and son, Henry, 15 months. Charlotte wore a simple drawing of the earth around her neck, her hair adorned with leaves.\n\n"We\'re here as a family for the future of our kids," she said.\n\nCharlotte Moore, 4, at the . She and her parents are marching for her future.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 Alia E. Dastagir (@alia_e)\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice in McLean, Va., and Larry Copeland in Atlanta\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1sfugYB\n\nWatch what happened off-camera at the Oscars\n\nFeb 23, 2015'

S'All Eyes On Obama, World Leaders At Climate Change Summit : NPR\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAll Eyes On Obama, World Leaders At Climate Change Summit\n\n*\n*\n*\n\nDemonstrators make their way down Sixth Avenue in New York during the People\'s Climate March on Sunday.\n\nJason DeCrow/AP\n\nhide caption\n\nitoggle caption\n\nDemonstrators make their way down Sixth Avenue in New York during the People\'s Climate March on Sunday.\n\nThe forecast calls for picture-perfect weather Tuesday in New York City as world leaders gather to discuss the challenge of a changing climate.\n\nMore than 120 leaders, including President Obama, are expected to attend the one-day climate summit, sponsored by the United Nations. They\'ve been instructed to arrive with "bold ideas" to slow the rise in global temperatures.\n\nSeveral hundred thousand through midtown Manhattan on Sunday. The demonstration, dubbed the People\'s Climate March, was intended to turn up the heat on a U.N. process that\'s sometimes glacially slow. Elana Sulakshana was part of a sizable contingent who marched from Columbia University.\n\n"It\'s really exciting. I\'ve never seen so much energy around an issue," Sulakshana said. "People just seem ready to take on the world leaders who haven\'t been doing anything on climate change."\n\nClimate experts say there\'s little time to waste. A surge in carbon dioxide last year pushed greenhouse gas levels to an all-time high. According to the National Climate Assessment, the past decade was the hottest on record in the United States. This spring, President Obama told WLTX television in South Carolina it\'s not too late to turn things around.\n\n"That\'s something we can do, but only if the American people push Washington to do it," the president said. "Because typically politicians are wary about doing something on their own, particularly if they\'re not sure the public supports it."\n\nAnd Americans are deeply divided, about not only how to address climate change but whether it\'s a problem at all. Carroll Doherty of the Pew Research Center says in a poll last month, 68 percent of Democrats called climate change a major threat to the U.S., concern on a par with Islamic extremism. But only 25 percent of Republicans feel that way.\n\n"It\'s one of the most partisan issues we track," Doherty said. "Republicans just do not see it as an imminent problem for the United States. But Democrats by and large do."\n\nEven among Democrats, there\'s disagreement about how far to go in controlling greenhouse gases. Many Democrats from big coal-producing areas, for example, are not happy with the president\'s planned EPA regulations clamping down on coal-fired power plants.\n\nBut if action on climate change is a liability with some voters, Democrats hope to make it an asset with others.\n\n"In many of these campaigns, climate is being used as a wedge issue, focused on Republicans," said Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist for a climate superPAC that\'s pumping money from billionaire Tom Steyer into a half-dozen close contests around the country. "And that to me is a real sign that climate politics [are] on the move and on the move in a good direction."\n\nLehane says climate issues resonate with young voters and, if properly framed, with African-Americans and Latinos, precisely the groups most likely to sit out the midterm elections. Lehane says a climate message can help mobilize those voters if it\'s presented not as an esoteric issue about polar bears, but as a close-to-home concern such as drought, smokestack pollution or the rising cost of flood insurance.\n\n"You do need to bring it down to the kitchen table, so that people actually understand the impact it\'s having on them, their families [and] their kids," Lehane said. "When you do that, it\'s an entirely different conversation, and people are motivated in terms of who they\'re going to vote [for] and whether or not they\'re going to turn out to vote."\n\nThe outcome of those November contests will help to determine how much of a weapon climate action \xe2\x80\x94 or inaction \xe2\x80\x94 may be in future U.S. political campaigns.\n\nThis week\'s New York summit is designed to set the stage for another round of international climate negotiations in Paris next year. The White House says President Obama will be in a better position to lead that effort if he\'s able to set an example here at home.\n\nCorrection\n\nA previous Web version of this story said that "tens of thousands" of people marched in Manhattan on Sunday. But organizers, assisted by a data analyst, estimate there were several hundred thousand people in the crowd. Photos and video also make clear that the crowd was much larger than "tens of thousands" would imply.\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nMore From Politics\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\n\nNPR thanks our sponsors\n\nSupport comes from:'

S'Massachusetts students to join massive NYC climate change march - Metro - The Boston Globe\n\nMassachusetts students to join massive NYC climate change march - Metro - The Boston Globe\n\nBy Jennifer SmithGlobe Correspondent September 21, 2014\n\nVarshini Prakash, UMass Amherst senior who has been involved in the UMass Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign.\n\nHigh school and college students may not be known for rising early, but hundreds of them will pile onto buses bound for New York City before sunrise on Sunday to join a massive demonstration for climate action.\n\nFrom campuses across the state, the students will depart at 5:30 a.m. for the bus trip followed by a five-hour march.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to power nap and drink a lot of coffee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marcus Wade, 17, a senior at Dorchester Academy and member of the Boston Student Advisory Council, a coalition of high school advocates.\n\nMore than 100,000 people are expected to take part in the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March, including 2,500 to 5,000\nfrom Massachusetts, said Emily Kirkland, communications coordinator for the Better Future Project, a grass-roots climate activism group.\n\nThe march coincides with a United Nations Climate Summit on Tuesday. The secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, plans to join the marchers on Sunday.\n\nThe issue of climate change hits many young people personally, Wade said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we become adults, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to live in this world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur children are going to have to live in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We have a 15-year time frame to turn this around before we\xe2\x80\x99re gambling with our futures.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a 15-year time frame to turn this around before we\xe2\x80\x99re gambling with our futures,\xe2\x80\x9d said Varshini Prakash, 21, a University of Massachusetts Amherst senior who has been involved in the UMass Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign.\n\nNews of the demonstration has been spread through grass-roots, word-of-mouth efforts, headed by community leaders and students.\n\nThe Boston Student Advisory Council has been working on building awareness of the march since the beginning of the summer.\n\nStudents spoke with Boston city councilors, put together banners and T-shirts, and maintained a strong social media presence leading up to the march, said Boston Latin Academy junior Savina Tapia, 16.\n\nJenny Sazama, a director and co-founder of Youth on Board, said many of the students with whom she works became interested in climate activism this year.\n\nAfter participating in a rally against the Keystone pipeline project, which would bring oil from the tar sands fields of Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, \xe2\x80\x9cthey were in,\xe2\x80\x9d Sazama said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey said \xe2\x80\x98this is our future; this is us.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYouth on Board partners with Boston Public Schools and student leadership groups. Another group involved in the march, the College Democrats of Massachusetts, is among the event\xe2\x80\x99s more than 1,000 sponsors.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile environmentalists and labor have fought in the past over fossil fuel infrastructure projects, in New York City they will be united in a call for green jobs and stringent cuts to greenhouse gas emissions,\xe2\x80\x9d the group said in a statement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about glaciers, it\xe2\x80\x99s about providing our communities with a just, livable future,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hispanic Caucus Chair Andres Vargas.\n\nHeading the march are people at the front lines of the climate change struggle, according to the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate. This includes indigenous peoples, environmental justice groups, and people from communities affected by climate changes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we talk about low-income people and people of color, they have already been marginalized and disenfranchised,\xe2\x80\x9d Prakash said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey receive the worst impacts of climate change.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn poorer communities with limited institutional support, climate change has a hyperlocal effect, said David Jenkins, program director of Roxbury Environmental Empowerment Project. What can seem like varied struggles for better public transportation, or for fewer emissions to improve air quality, are \xe2\x80\x9call one fight\xe2\x80\x9d for better environmental policy, he said.\n\nThe group is using its trip as a way \xe2\x80\x9cto mobilize young people, people of color, and lower-income people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nRoxbury student turnout was beyond the organizers\xe2\x80\x99 expectations, said Jenkins.\n\nThe Alternatives for Community and Environment organization, with which Jenkins works, will send seven buses to the march, carrying a total of more than 300 passengers mostly from youth groups.\n\nThe Better Future Project/350 Massachusetts is sending 30 buses, three times their earlier estimate, Kirkland said. That leaves a wait list of more than 500 people who probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make the trip because they ran out of buses, she said.\n\nStudent groups, religious congregations, community groups, and labor unions have organized additional transportation of at least 30 more buses.\n\nThe march will wend its way from Central Park West at 86th Street to 11th Avenue at 34th Street, beginning at 11:30 a.m. and ending at about 4:30 p.m., according to the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate.\n\nAs the generation poised to feel a strong impact from climate change, said Jenkins, the young have a stake in the matter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking specifically about our future,\xe2\x80\x9d Prakash said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people who are around now to make those changes will not be dealing with the ramifications.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJennifer Smith can be reached at\n\nor\n\nPlease enter a valid email\n\ndiv>\n\ndiv>\n\nRead it all, now.'

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon walked with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore along the 2\xc2\xbd-mile route. Celebrity protesters included comedian Chris Rock and actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo, who said he was marching for his children\'s future.\n\n"I see the world changing very quickly already, and I want to do my best to give them the best world that they deserve to have and that I was fortunate to come up into," Ruffalo told CNN.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nJust Watched\n\nPLAY VIDEO\n\nRicken Patel, the founding executive director of march organizer Avaaz, told CNN the "solution is so clear. It\'s to get to a 100% clean energy power society and economy."\n\n"We\'re seeing massive droughts across the Midwest and California," Patel said. "We\'re seeing storms that are devastating the East Coast and the Gulf Coast. We\'re seeing flooding that\'s threatened this city and many others. All of those impacts that are happening, but it is just a taste test of what\'s to come if we don\'t urgently reverse course."\n\nThe Environmental Defense Fund said it expected up to 100,000 people to walk, while the New York Police Department predicted about 30,000 would participate.\n\nRallies were also held in London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and Bogota, Colombia.\n\nWorld leaders converge on the U.N. headquarters in New York to offer and discuss climate change proposals starting Tuesday.\n\nSpeakers will include President Obama and DiCaprio, who was recently appointed as U.N. Messenger for Peace with a focus on climate change.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*'

S'Towards a treaty: The shadow of Copenhagen | The Economist\n\nNEXT year the signatories to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change will meet in Paris to try to negotiate a new agreement\xe2\x80\x94just as they did in Copenhagen in 2009. Those Nordic negotiations ended in acrimony: one non-governmental organisation (NGO) described the city as \xe2\x80\x9ca climate crime scene...with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport in shame.\xe2\x80\x9d Five years later, has anything changed?\n\nPlenty, say many NGOs. The costs of climate change are becoming clearer, according to recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists who advise governments. There is more agreement among governments, economists and business people that climate change will be a big economic problem unless checked. The preliminary UN powwow in New York next week is intended to build on this feeling of common concern.\n\nAnd the politics seem more promising. While Barack Obama could not get any new agreement ratified by America\xe2\x80\x99s Senate, his use of the Environmental Protection Agency to limit carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants gives the world a token of good faith that was lacking before. Climate policy has a higher priority under Xi Jinping, China\xe2\x80\x99s president, than it did under Hu Jintao, his predecessor. Narendra Modi, India\xe2\x80\x99s new prime minister, was a pioneer of green policies when chief minister of Gujarat. Europe\xe2\x80\x99s aspiration to global green leadership may be waning, but it is still keen on a deal.\n\nThe New York summit will be a forum for political declarations (though not by Mr Xi or Mr Modi, who are not planning to attend). The countries will say what they are prepared to commit to in Paris at the end of March 2015. It seems likely that any treaty will be mild, nudging not pushing countries into reining in emissions. But in part because of that mildness, the chances of a signing look greater now than at any time since 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost commented\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSections\n\nDebate and discussion\n\nBlogs\n\nResearch and insights'
